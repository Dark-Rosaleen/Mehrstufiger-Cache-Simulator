# Cache Simulation Project

## Overview
This project aims to investigate the impact of multi-level caches on runtime and latency of an algorithm. It's build by simulating caches (its' size, architectures, and latencies) in modern processors. The implementation of the cache simulation used SystemC and C++, the framework program is in C.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

| Language | Version |
|----------|---------|
| C        | C17     |
| C++      | C++14   |
| SystemC  | 2.3.3   |

More Details:
- C Compiler (GCC recommended) supporting C17 standard
- C++ Compiler (G++ recommended) supporting C++14 standard
- SystemC library version 2.3.3

If you do not have these prerequisites installed, please refer to the respective documentation for installation instructions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine. Open a terminal and execute the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/Dark-Rosaleen/GRA-Abschlussprojekt.git`

2. **Verify Installation of Prerequisites**: Ensure that the required versions of C, C++, and SystemC are installed on your system. If you are unsure or need to install the prerequisites, run the provided `setup.sh` script by executing: `bash ./src/assets/scripts/setup.sh`
This script will guide you through the installation of any missing prerequisites.

3. **Build the Project**: With the prerequisites in place, compile the project using the `make` command. In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and execute: `make`

## Running the Simulation

After successfully compiling the project, you can run the cache simulation with the following command: `./cache [FLAG(s)] filename.csv`

Replace `[FLAG(s)]` with any flags you wish to use during the simulation and `filename.csv` with the path to your input CSV file containing the simulation requests.

### List of Available Flags
