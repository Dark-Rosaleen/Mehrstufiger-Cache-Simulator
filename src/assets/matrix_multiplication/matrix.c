/**
 * @brief Initialize Square Matrix of size `n` with random values
 * 
 * @note
 * Represent matrix A[x][y] as A[x * width + y].
 * We are doing this because cache normally load adjacent address to a cache line
 * 
 * @details
 * Example Matrix A[3][3] as A[9]
 * [ 0,0 | 0,1 | 0,2 | 1,0 | 1,1 | 1,2 | 2,0 | 2,1 | 2,2 ]
 * 
 * If we have cache size x-KB, with each cache line of 64 Bytes (cache line count = x * 1000 / 64)
 * then we can save 64 / 4 = 16 data in one cache line
 * (Assume metadatas such as Tags, Dirty Bit, Valid Bit is very small - can be counted out here)
 * 
 * That means, loading A[0][0] would leads to A[0][1], ..., A[0][15] loaded to that cache line too
 * Therefore, when doing matrix operation by row, chance of cache hit would be bigger
 * 
 * Other notable thing is that by doing row access, we have very low stride.
 * Meaning we don't skip many elements during iteration - higher cache hit.
 * Stride = fixed distance (ex. stride of 4 = acc every (multiple of 4)th - element)
 * 
 * Which is also has relation to Spatial Locality:
 * If a memory location is accessed, nearby memory locations are likely to be accessed soon.
 * 
 * @warning
 * I assume our cache implementation has:
 * 1. Load Blocks (address adjacent is also loaded to that cache Line)

/**
 * @brief A[i][k] * B[k][j] = C[i][j]
 * 
 * @note
 * This function multiplies matrices in the order of i, j, k
 * 
 * This function should have good cache performance because it accesses the elements of the matrices 
 * in a row-major order, which is how theyâ€™re stored in memory in C/C++.
 * 
 * @details
 * 1. The sum C[] is written back until the most inner loop k is finished. 
 * Thus, no cache access (read) for C[], we only do (write) for that C[]. 
 * 
 * 2. The Matrix B is accessed by Collumn (vertical) - high cache Miss -> high reload
 * Then, cost of cache access (read) for B[] is 1 (each call = load once)
 * 
 * 3. Accesses to Matrix A here is efficient, due to row-based access
 * Suppose each cache Line = 16 data, then once every 16 reads, we just need to load once = 1/16 cost
 * 
 * Conclusion - expected number of cache misses per access:
 * 1. C = 0 (no read)
 * 2. B = 1 (each access to B is a miss)
 * 3. A = 1/16 (every 16th access is a miss)
 * 
 * So, memory access per instruction (per cell) = 0 + 1 + 1/16 = count for yourself
 * For each cell operation in the matrix multiplication, expect to have >= 1 memory access on average due to cache misses.
